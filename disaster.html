    <title>My Failed Attempts and Early Versions</title>
</head>

    <h3 class="HC">OHHH... look who came to see my failed attempts and early version!</h3>
    <div>So this is where I document all my disasters, failed builds, and learning moments. Not every idea turns out perfect, and that's totally okay! Here, you'll find the projects that didn't go as planned, the mistakes I made, and what I learned from them. It's all part of the creative process, and I'm sharing it to show that failure is just a stepping stone to success. Feel free to explore, learn from my missteps, and maybe even laugh a little at the chaos. After all, every disaster is just a lesson in disguise!</div>
