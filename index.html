        <div><p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I will probably showcase my ideas that I built, broke, fixed, and occasionally overthought. I know that this might look like a candyfloss(basically I'm aware that I'm a bad designer), but don't let the pastel calm fool you; there's a lot of curiosity, late-night learning, and trial-and-error hiding underneath. I like turning random ideas into actual things, learning by doing, and figuring stuff out even when it gets messy. This space is less about perfection and more about progress, experiments, and having fun while creating. (also I'm more into hardware so this is my first software project in form of a web page, so DON'T expect too much lol)</p></div>
