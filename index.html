            <p>HI! THATS ME (my name is Alisha). A builder of cool things with hardware and web ideas.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I will probably showcase my ideas that I built, broke, fixed, and occasionally overthought. I know, this looks like a digital comic book (I did it intentionally), but don't let the pastel calm fool you (Also if you don't find it visually appealing, let me tell you that I'm a hardware nerd, not a designer). Beneath the surface is a chaotic splash page of curiosity and late-night 'why isn't this working?' energy. I like turning random ideas into actual things, learning by doing, and figuring stuff out even when it gets messy. This space is less about perfection and more about progress, experiments, and having fun while creating. (also I'm more into hardware so this is my first software project in form of a web page, so DON'T expect too much lol)</p>

                <h3 class="HC">OHHH... look who came to see my early version!<h3>
                    <p>So this is where I document all my disasters, failed builds, and learning moments. Not every idea turns out perfect, and that's totally okay! Here, you'll find the projects that didn't go as planned, the mistakes I made, and what I learned from them. It's all part of the creative process, and I'm sharing it to show that failure is just a stepping stone to success. Feel free to explore, learn from my missteps, and maybe even laugh a little at the chaos. After all, every disaster is just a lesson in disguise!</p>

                        <p>I'd like to share this with you because it was a big milestone for me. It was the first time I managed to get a working schematic without any errors. It felt amazing and gave me confidence to keep building more complex projects!</p>
