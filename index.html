        <div><p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I will probably showcase my ideas that I built, broke, fixed, and occasionally overthought. I know, this looks like a digital comic book (I did it intentionally), but don't let the pastel calm fool you (Also if you don't find it visually appealing, let me tell you that I'm a hardware nerd, not a designer). Beneath the surface is a chaotic splash page of curiosity and late-night 'why isn't this working?' energy. I like turning random ideas into actual things, learning by doing, and figuring stuff out even when it gets messy. This space is less about perfection and more about progress, experiments, and having fun while creating. (also I'm more into hardware so this is my first software project in form of a web page, so DON'T expect too much lol)</p></div>
