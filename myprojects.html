    <p>So this is where I document all my disasters, failed builds, and learning moments. Not every idea turns out perfect, and that's totally okay! Here, you'll find the projects that didn't go as planned, the mistakes I made, and what I learned from them. It's all part of the creative process, and I'm sharing it to show that failure is just a stepping stone to success. Feel free to explore, learn from my missteps, and maybe even laugh a little at the chaos. After all, every disaster is just a lesson in disguise!</p>

        <img src="schematic.png" alt="schematic"><h3 id="success">This was my first schematic that ran without any errors!</h3>
            <p>I'd like to share this with you because it was a big milestone for me. It was the first time I managed to get a working schematic without any errors. It felt amazing and gave me confidence to keep building more complex projects!</p></section>
